An annual employee perception survey has been conducted by the Australian Public Service
(APS) since 2012. The survey captures the attitude and opinion data on important issues
such as innovation, leadership, wellbeing, learning and development, and engagement of the
APS workforce. It allows all APS employees to voice their opinions about their workplace and
contribute to making the public sector a better place to work.

This information is used by agencies and the APSC to target plans for improving APS
workplace competence today and in the future. It is used to assess, adjust, and improve APS
employees' workplace conditions and environment.

All available APS staff were asked to participate in the 2014 APS employee census. The
census took place from May 12 to June 15, 2014. The employee census had 99,392
responses, representing a 68 percent response rate. (Australian Public Service Commission,
2015)

From May 10th, through June 11th, 2021, 42,493 employees from 101 APS agencies were
invited to participate. A total of 109,537 APS employees responded, representing a 77
percent response rate. (Australian Public Service Commission, 2021)
This census method gives a complete picture of the APS and assures that no eligible
respondents are left out of the survey sample, eliminating sampling bias and minimizing
sample error.
